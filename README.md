# anomaly_detection_in_multivariate_signals
Use LSTM auto encoder model to identify anomalies in multi variate input signals from a machine. Data has already been pre-processed and normalized. A drift in data was observed from July which necessited retraining the model.The retrained model was saved as an API and tested using POSTMAN.
